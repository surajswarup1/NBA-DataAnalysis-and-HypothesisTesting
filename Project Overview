The goal of this project was to answer a few questions on a dataset to come up with the most informative and 
insightful takeaways I could find. In the field of analytics, often times we are tasked with finding insights regarding 
a dataset we have never seen before, and this includes data cleaning, data manipulation, data visualization, and ultimately 
data analysis to best derive meaningful value. I used a dataset I found on Kaggle to simulate this real-world analytics 
problem that many of us deal with on a day-to-day basis. The code used to conduct this analysis is attached in this GitHub repository.
 
Because business case scenarios require both easily digestible information and actionable insights, I aimed to answer the 
following questions with further explanations as to why I felt they were important questions to tackle:

Q1. Count Number of USA Born vs Non-USA Born Players by Season
Q2. Highest PPG of USA Born vs Non-USA Born Players by Season
Q3. Average PPG of USA Born vs Non-USA Born Players by Season
Q4. Average age of Players by NBA conference and by Season
Q5. Count players that avg over 20ppg by conference and by Season
Q6. Blue Blood College vs Not PPG by Season
Q7. Count of Blue Blood College vs Not Blue Blood College Players by Draft Position
Q8. Blue Blood College vs Not Average Usage by Season
Q9. Count players by Season that have scored over 20ppg based on draft round
Q10. Count players that Avg over 20ppg by Team
Q11. NBA Player Height by Season
